Join this program to learn more about two critically important programs that offer paid summer opportunities. The Office of Alternate Defense Counsel, https://www.coloradoadc.org/  provides paid contractor opportunities for students to work as members of interdisciplinary defense teams across Colorado for the summer.  These paid opportunities are facilitated through a peer-to-peer mentorship program, that aims at increasing legal services in more remote parts of the state where there is a shortage of attorneys and legal professionals.  OADC continues to partner with other state agencies as we work to build additional workforce capacity in Rural Colorado, through our paid contractor opportunities. The Greater Colorado Law Student Experience, now run through the Colorado Access to Justice Commission https://www.coloradoaccesstojustice.org/, is a combined Judicial and Private Practice/Public Interest internship designed to expose students to the possibilities of legal practice outside of the metro area and facilitate their connections with a rural Colorado community. Interns spend 3 days a week at their site’s Judicial Branch and one day each week working with a community partner (like Colorado Legal Services, Eagle Valley Land Trust, and The Ute Mountain Ute Tribe). On Fridays, interns are free to explore their site and Greater Colorado. The 2025 GCLSE sites are Alamosa, The Central Mountain Region (Edwards, Breckenridge, and Leadville), Cortez, Northern Colorado (Greeley and Fort Collins), and Southeastern Colorado (La Junta and Lamar).

In Israel, De-Nur lived a life shrouded in secrecy, concealing his identity behind the pseudonym “Ka-Tzetnik 135633.” His books – works of fiction informed by the horror of the two years he spent in Auschwitz – were widely read in the 1950s and 1960s and influenced the way readers worldwide imagined the Holocaust. In one of the most dramatic moments of the 1961 Eichmann trial, De-Nur collapsed on the stand while recounting the terrors of his experience at Auschwitz, which he described as “The Other Planet”—a place of horror beyond the realm of human understanding. Increasingly haunted by the trauma of his experiences, De-Nur later turned to experimental psychiatric therapy using LSD. For over a year, he underwent treatment in the Netherlands, revisiting his memories from Auschwitz in search of clarity, peace, and a way back from \"The Other Planet.\" Through the enigma and the legacy of Ka.Tzetnik, Return From The Other Planet examines how individuals and societies reconcile a traumatic past with a return to life.Following the film, Lapid will be joined by clinical psychologist AJ Grovert for a conversation about the use of psychedelics in the treatment of trauma The Fred & Audrey Friedman Marcus Holocaust Lecture is presented by the Holocaust Awareness Institute at the University of Denver's Center for Judaic Studies, in partnership with the Mizel Arts and Culture Center and the Denver Jewish Film Festival.

But why? What value do these animal festivals and their rituals hold, and why, when animals are in distress, do we insist that the show must go on? In the forthcoming book Forget the Camel: The Madcap World of Animal Festivals and What They Say About Being Human, lawyer and animal advocate Elizabeth MeLampy explores how these spectacles—where animals become both unwitting performers and powerful symbols—illuminate the complex intersection of animal welfare and cultural tradition. During this talk, MeLampy will share stories about the groundhogs, butterflies, rattlesnakes, lobsters, sled dogs, and other creatures she met during her research. She will also discuss how traditions and rituals can reinforce deeply ingrained paradigms for how we treat animals, and how we might move towards a more compassionate future where animals are not deployed as symbols to tell our human stories. Lunch will be provided! Please register here."

      "description": "Restorative Denver is a partnership between the Denver District Attorney’s Office and The Conflict Center (TCC), a community-based nonprofit with over 30 years of experience in conflict transformation and restorative practices. Eligible cases are screened by the DA’s Office and then referred to TCC where they participate in a community-based restorative justice process called community-group conferencing. Successful cases are dismissed and sealed. Restorative Justice helps harmed parties or crime victims feel supported and empowered and allows parties who caused harm or defendants to understand the impact of their actions and repair the harm they caused to the greatest extent possible. In the first 3 years of the program, 273 cases were referred, 206 people successfully completed the program, and only 6 were unsuccessful. Additionally, only 3% of people who have successfully completed Restorative Denver have recidivated, which is remarkably low compared to other criminal system interventions. Come learn about this innovative and important alternative to the traditional criminal system from multiple perspectives and learn how you can get further involved. Guest Speakers: Beth Yohe (The Conflict Center); Chris Brown-Haugen (Denver DA, Restorative Justice & Diversion Unit), Kylee Wellons (Restorative Denver), Heidi Cardenas (Restorative Denver), Colleen Kelley (CO State Public Defender-Denver Office), Liz Porter-Merrill (CO State Public Defender, State Office).

MixDIP was founded in 2014 by now-retired Magistrate Judge Kristen Mix and is designed to provide diverse CU and DU law students with fall semester public-sector internships. The program features internship opportunities with a variety of public employers, and students who participate receive academic credit based on the amount of time they devote to the internship. The leadership team includes Judge Mix, Judge Kato Crews from the U.S. District Court, and representatives from CU Law and DU Law. The program encourages law students to apply who have been historically underrepresented in the legal profession because of their race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin, or other statuses. MixDIP is in its twelfth year and has placed more than three hundred local law students in public-sector internships – many have found their niche in public-sector work as a result.

      "time": "5:30pm - 7:00pm",
      "description": "Animal advocates are no longer the only voice challenging animal experimentation on grounds of ethics and efficiency. While animal-based research and the 3R principle continue to be a dominant modality for scientific research, a growing cohort of laboratory scientists have taken notice of the model’s poor results in contemporary times to advance knowledge about human disease or generate human-relevant drugs or treatment. Some have further questioned the mainstream scientific talking point that animal experimentation is a “necessary evil”. Concerns scientists critical of animal experimentation typically cite are the inefficiencies of the antiquated animal-based models given the field’s actual evidence-based impacts, the unnecessariness of animal models given new approach methodologies to replace them, and the ongoing ethical implications for animals of part or all of a life spent as an involuntary research subject. In this talk, Maneesha Deckha, Professor and Lansdowne Chair at the Faculty of Law at the University of Victoria, demonstrates a different reason to further revitalize questioning of the ethical basis for contemporary animal-based research: its elitist nature in terms of the humans it stands to benefit and the interhuman global health inequities it exacerbates."

      "description": "The story of the Exodus is a significant one for people of the Jewish faith. The Exodus event is arguably the most monumental in human history. When Jews observe Passover, it commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. It is a pivotal moment in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) where the God who is One liberates an enslaved Hebrew people from the oppression of the Egyptians. Rabbi Irving Greenbaum writes, “Exodus morality meant giving justice to the weak and the poor.” It should come as no surprise, therefore, that enslaved Africans in the United States, upon hearing this narrative, immediately felt a resonance. For them, a God who freed slaves so long ago would surely also free them. For the enslaved African community, Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad, would become for them, Moses. The music of this concert will celebrate Jewish and African American faith and freedom, and the importance of the Exodus narrative for both.

Co-sponsored by the Holocaust Awareness Institute at the Center for Judaic Studies. The signature concert of The Defiant Requiem Foundation, Defiant Requiem: Verdi at Terezín, tells the story of the courageous Jewish prisoners in the Theresienstadt Concentration Camp (Terezín) during World War II who performed Verdi’s Requiem while experiencing the depths of human degradation. With only a single smuggled score, they performed the celebrated oratorio sixteen times, including one performance before senior SS officials from Berlin and an International Red Cross delegation. Conductor Rafael Schächter told the choir, “We will sing to the Nazis what we cannot say to them.” Defiant Requiem: Verdi at Terezín is a concert-drama that was conceived and created by Foundation President, Maestro Murry Sidlin. It combines the magnificent music of Verdi with video testimony from survivors of the original Terezín chorus and footage from the 1944 Nazi propaganda film about Theresienstadt. The performance also includes actors who speak the words of imprisoned conductor Rafael Schächter and others. Defiant Requiem is not just a performance of the Verdi Requiem, but a tribute to the inspired leadership of Rafael Schächter who was forced to reconstitute the choir three times as members were transported to Auschwitz. The performances came to symbolize resistance and defiance and demonstrated the prisoners’ courage to confront the worst of mankind with the best of mankind. Defiant Requiem: Verdi at Terezín is powerful, dramatic and inspirational.
